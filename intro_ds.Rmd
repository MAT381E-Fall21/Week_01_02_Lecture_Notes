# What is Data Science?

* According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science): 
  * Data science is an **interdisciplinary** field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured.

 * Data science is a **concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and their related methods** to **understand and analyze actual phenomena** with data. 

 * It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of **mathematics**, **statistics**, **information science**, and **computer science**.

- According to [Lawtomated](https://lawtomated.com/structured-data-vs-unstructured-data-what-are-they-and-why-care/), unstructured data comes from:     
  - **Social Media:** YouTube, Instagram, Twitter.
  - **Mobile data:** text messages, locations.
  - **Media:** MP3, digital photos, audio recordings and video files.
  - **Satellite imagery:** atmospheric images, geographic forms, military movements.
  - **Scientific data:** oil and gas exploration, space exploration, and seismic imagery.
  
---
- According to [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/wiki/data-science/) (rephrased version of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) definition):
  - Data science is the field of study that combines **domain expertise**, **programming skills**, and knowledge of **mathematics** and **statistics** to extract meaningful insights from data. 
 - Data science practitioners apply machine learning algorithms to **numbers, text, images, video, audio, and more** to produce artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence. 
 - In turn, these systems generate insights which analysts and business users can translate into tangible **business value**.

- "Algorithmic bias describes **systematic and repeatable errors** in a computer system
that create **unfair outcomes**, such as privileging one arbitrary groups of users over others." -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias)

- "Machine learning bias generally stems from problems introduced by the individuals who design and/or train the machine learning systems. These individuals could either **create algorithms** that reflect **unintended cognitive biases** or **real-life prejudices**. Or the individuals could introduce biases because they use **incomplete, faulty or prejudicial data sets** to train and/or validate the machine learning systems." -[Margaret Rouse](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/machine-learning-bias-algorithm-bias-or-AI-bias)

- EU-funded research project using artificial intelligence for facial “lie detection” with the aim of **speeding up immigration checks**.
- The research in question is controversial because the notion of an accurate lie detector machine remains science fiction, and with good reason: There’s no evidence of a **“universal psychological signal”** for deceit.

 - The growth of this tech in the past decade—not just **Siri** but **Alexa** and **Cortana** and others—has unveiled a problem in it: **racial bias**.
- "Koenecke points to the most likely: the **data used for training**, which are predominantly from **white, native speakers of American English**. By using databases that are narrow both in the words that are used and how they are said, **training systems exclude accents and other ways of speaking that have unique linguistic features**." 
- On average, the authors found, all five programs from leading technology companies, including Apple and Microsoft, showed significant **race disparities**; they were roughly **twice as likely to incorrectly transcribe audio from Black speakers** compared with white speakers.
- This effectively censors voices that are not part of the **standard languages** or accents used to create these technologies.
- For someone with a **disability** who is dependent on these technologies, **being misunderstood** could have serious consequences.

# How can we avoid algorithmic bias?

- Magaret Mitchell wrote a paper about AI safety and ethical concerns related to language models such as GPT3 and BERT. 

---

- " ...human beings cannot overcome all forms of bias. But slowing down and learning
what those traps are -as well as how to recognize and challenge them- is critical."  Yael Eisenstat (CIA analyst, diplomat and national security advisor at the White House).

- Several ways to **avoid bias**:
  - Data management.
  - Choice of algorithm.
  - Transparency.
  - Diverse data science teams.
  - Speak out!..
