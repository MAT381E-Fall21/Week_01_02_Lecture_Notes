# Knowing your way around RStudio

- The `RStudio` IDE a free open-source product (under the
[Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)).

- We will use `RStudio` as a graphical front-end to `R`, so that we can access our scripts and data, find help, and preview plots and outputs all in one place.

- To function correctly, `RStudio` needs `R` and therefore **both** need to be installed on your computer. 

   - You can download the recent version of `R` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Select the link appropriate for your operating system.

   - Then, download  the recent version of `RStudio` from the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (select the free open source desktop version).

   - If you are using a Mac, in addition to `R` and `RStudio`, you need to download [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/).

- Visit [R/RStudio set up video](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/00-setup/).

}
&lt;/style&gt;

- `RStudio` is divided into 4 "Panes" (small windows): 
   - The **Source** for your scripts and documents  (top-left, in the default layout), 
   - The R **Console** (bottom-left), 
   - Your **Environment/History** (top-right), and 
   - Your **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom-right).

# How to start an R project?

- It is **always good practice** to keep a set of related data and analyses in **a single folder**. 

  * Start `RStudio`.
  * Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `New project`.
  * As directory (or folder) name enter `r-intro` and create project as sub-directory of your desktop folder: `~/Desktop`.
  * Click on `Create project`.
  * Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
  create a folder named `data` within your newly created working directory (e.g., `~/r-intro/data`).
  * On the main menu go to `Files` &gt; `New File` &gt; `R Script` to open a new file and
  * Save the empty script as `r-intro-script.R` in your working directory.

---
- A quick side note: If you are interested in file management/data science work flow, I suggest you to read the following article:

       http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-03-07_reproducible_pipeline/.


---
- If you need to check which working directory `R` thinks it is in:


```r
getwd()
[1] "/Users/gulinan/Desktop/r-intro"
```

- To set a different working directory in `R` go to the `Console` and type:


```r
setwd("Path/To/Your/Newworkingdirectory")
```

---
# RStudio Console and Command Prompt

- The console pane in `RStudio` is the place where **commands written** in the `R`
language can be **typed** and **executed** immediately by the computer.
- It is also where
the **results will be shown** for commands that have been executed. 
- You can type
commands directly into the console and press &lt;kbd&gt;`Enter`&lt;/kbd&gt; to execute those commands, but they will be **forgotten when you close the session**.
- If `R` is ready to accept commands, the `R` console by default shows a `&gt;` prompt.
- If it
receives a command, `R` will try to execute it, and when
ready, will **show the results** and come back with a new `&gt;` prompt to wait for new
commands.
- If `R` is **still waiting** for you to enter more data because it isn't complete yet,
the console will show a `+` prompt.

---
# RStudio Script Editor
- Because we want to keep our code and workflow properly, it is better to type
the commands in the **script editor**.
- We can create a new `R` script as follows: `File &gt; New File &gt; R Script` and then **save the script**.
- We can now write **commands** directly in the `R Script`.


```r
getwd()
[1] "/Users/gulinan/Desktop/r-intro"
```

- The command on the current line in the
script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in the **currently
selected text** will be sent to the console and executed when you press
&lt;kbd&gt;`Ctrl`&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;`Enter`&lt;/kbd&gt; (&lt;kbd&gt;`Cmd`&lt;/kbd&gt; +
&lt;kbd&gt;`Enter`&lt;/kbd&gt; on Mac). 

---
#  Creating objects in R
- To **create an `R` object**, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `&lt;-` and the value we want to give it:


```r
my_age &lt;- 25
```

- `&lt;-` is the **assignment operator** and as name suggests it assigns values on the right to objects on
the left. 
- You can also use `=`
for assignments, but not in every context (there are
[slight](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2008/12/use-equals-or-arrow-for-assignment.html) [differences](https://web.archive.org/web/20130610005305/https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2009-March/191462.html)).


- Just a note: What are known as `objects` in `R` are known as `variables` in many other
programming languages.  Depending on the context, `object` and `variable` can
have drastically different meanings.  However, in this lesson, the two words are
used synonymously. 

---
# How to name objects in R?
- Object names must start with a letter or a dot (if you start a name with a dot, the second character cannot be a number).
- Names should contain only letters, numbers, underscore characters (_), and dots (.).
- Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. 
- Object names should be **explicit** and **not too long**. 
- R is **case sensitive**
(e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`). 
- There are some names that
cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in `R` (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a complete list). 
- In general, even if it is allowed, it's **best to not use other function names** (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use. 
- It's also best to
avoid dots (`.`) within a variable name as in `my.dataset`. There are many
functions in R with dots in their names for historical reasons, but because dots have a special meaning in `R` (for methods) and other programming languages, it is best to avoid them. 

---
- When assigning a value to an object, `R` does not print anything. 
- We can force `R` to print the value by **using parentheses** or by **typing the object name**:


```r
weight_kg &lt;- 55    # doesn't print anything
```


```r
(weight_kg &lt;- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
```

```
#&gt; [1] 55
```

```r
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

```
#&gt; [1] 55
```
- Now that `R` has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. 
- For instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):


```r
weight_kg * 2.2 
```

```
#&gt; [1] 121
```

---
# Comments

&lt;img src="images/commenting.png" width="80%" height="100%" /&gt;

--

- The **comment character** in `R` is hashtag (`#`).
- Anything to the right of a `#` in a script
will be ignored by `R`. 
- If you only want to comment
out one line, you can put the cursor at any location of that line (i.e. no need 
to select the whole line), then press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; + 
&lt;kbd&gt;C&lt;/kbd&gt;.
- `RStudio` makes it easy to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after selecting the
lines you  want to comment, press at the same time on your keyboard
&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;C&lt;/kbd&gt;. 

---

# Modes 
- Objects in `R` are classified according to their basic structure which is called as **modes**. 
- Table below shows the **most common ones**. 


|Name      |Example                 |
|:---------|:-----------------------|
|numeric   |`1`, `3`, `48`          |
|character |`Steve'`, `'a'`, `'78'` |
|logical   |`TRUE`, `FALSE`         |
-  For characters we can either use `" "` or `' '`. 

---
# Data types

- `R` has a number of different **data types**. 
-  Table below shows the ones you're most likely to come across (taken from [this source](https://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html)): 


|Name       |Description                                                                   |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|vector     |list of values with of the same variable mode                                 |
|matrix     |2D data structure                                                             |
|array      |same as matrix for higher dimensional data                                    |
|data frame |matrices in that different columns can have different modes                   |
|list       |flexible type that can contain different variable types with diffrent lenghts |
---
# Vectors 
- A vector is **composed by a series of values** where all of the values are the **same type of data**.
- We build vectors using the **concatenate function** `c()`.  


```r
weight_g &lt;- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)  # make a vector
weight_g
```

```
#&gt; [1] 21 34 39 54 55
```

- You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:


```r
weight_g &lt;- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g
```

```
#&gt; [1] 21 34 39 54 55 90
```

```r
weight_g &lt;- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g
```

```
#&gt; [1] 30 21 34 39 54 55 90
```


---
- The function `str()` provides an overview of the internal **str**ucture of an `R` object and its
elements. 
- It is a useful function when working with large and complex
objects:


```r
str(weight_g)
```

```
#&gt;  num [1:7] 30 21 34 39 54 55 90
```

- The function `class()` indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:


```r
class(weight_g)
```

```
#&gt; [1] "numeric"
```

- Note: `class` is a property assigned to an object that determines how **functions** operate with it.

---
- A vector can also contain **characters**:


```r
animals &lt;- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "frog")
class(animals)
```

```
#&gt; [1] "character"
```
- A vector can also contain **logical values** (the boolean data type).


```r
has_tail &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
class(has_tail)
```

```
#&gt; [1] "logical"
```


---


&lt;img src="images/index02.png" width="80%" height="100%" /&gt;

--

- `R` **indices start at 1**. 
-  Programming languages like `Fortran`, `MATLAB`, `Julia`, and `R` start
counting at 1, because that's what human beings typically do. 
-  Languages in the `C` family (including `C++`, `Java`, `Perl`, and `Python`) **count from 0** because that's simpler for computers to do.
---

# Subsetting vectors

- If we want to **extract one or several values from a vector**, we must provide one
or several indices in square brackets ([]). 


```r
animals[2]
```

```
#&gt; [1] "rat"
```

```r
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

```
#&gt; [1] "dog" "rat"
```

- The **colon operator** `:` is a special operator that **creates numeric vectors of integers** in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance. 
- We can use this to select a sequence, like this: 


```r
animals[2:4]
```

```
#&gt; [1] "rat"  "dog"  "frog"
```

---

- You can **exclude** elements of a vector using the "`-`" sign:


```r
animals[-2]
```

```
#&gt; [1] "mouse" "dog"   "frog"
```

```r
animals[-c(1:3)]
```

```
#&gt; [1] "frog"
```

- We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the
original one:


```r
more_animals &lt;- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

```
#&gt; [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"   "rat"   "mouse" "frog"
```
---
# Comparison Operators

- Table below shows the **comparison operators** that result in logical outputs. 

&lt;img src="images/comparison.png" width="80%" /&gt;

- The double equal sign `==` is a test for
numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be
confused with the single `=` sign, which performs variable assignment (similar
to `&lt;-`).

---
# Boolean Operators

- Table below shows the **Boolean operators** that are used to narrow or broaden search outputs. 

&lt;img src="images/boolean.png" width="80%" /&gt;

---

# Conditional subsetting

- Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. 
- `TRUE` will
select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not.


```r
animals
```

```
#&gt; [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"   "frog"
```

```r
logical_index &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
animals[logical_index]
```

```
#&gt; [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"
```

- Typically, these logical vectors are not typed out by hand, but are the output of
other functions or logical tests. 

---
- We can select only the weights above 50:

```r
weight_g
```

```
#&gt; [1] 30 21 34 39 54 55 90
```

```r
weight_g &gt; 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
```

```
#&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

```r
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g &gt; 50]
```

```
#&gt; [1] 54 55 90
```

- We can combine multiple tests using `&amp;` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|`
(at least one of the conditions is true, OR):


```r
weight_g[weight_g &lt; 30 | weight_g &gt; 50]
```

```
#&gt; [1] 21 54 55 90
```

```r
weight_g[weight_g &gt;= 30 &amp; weight_g &lt;= 90]
```

```
#&gt; [1] 30 34 39 54 55 90
```

---
- The **(in) operator** `%in%` is very useful for searching **certain strings in a vector**.


```r
x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)
2 %in% x  #is 2 in x vector
```

```
#&gt; [1] TRUE
```

```r
c(3, 4) %in% x #is elements of c(3, 4) available in x vector
```

```
#&gt; [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

```r
animals
```

```
#&gt; [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"   "frog"
```

```r
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog") #is elements of animals vector available in that vector
```

```
#&gt; [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

# Missing data

-  **Missing data** is represented as `NA`.
-  When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. 
-  We can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result **while ignoring
the missing values**.


```r
heights &lt;- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
max(heights)
```

```
#&gt; [1] NA
```

```r
sum(heights)
```

```
#&gt; [1] NA
```

```r
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```
#&gt; [1] 6
```

```r
sum(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```
#&gt; [1] 16
```

---
- If the data include missing values, we may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, `complete.cases()`. 


```r
# Extract elements which are not missing values.
heights
```

```
#&gt; [1]  2  4  4 NA  6
```

```r
!is.na(heights)
```

```
#&gt; [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

```r
heights[!is.na(heights)]
```

```
#&gt; [1] 2 4 4 6
```

---

```r
# Extract elements which are not missing values.
na.omit(heights)
```

```
#&gt; [1] 2 4 4 6
#&gt; attr(,"na.action")
#&gt; [1] 4
#&gt; attr(,"class")
#&gt; [1] "omit"
```

```r
# Extract elements which are complete cases.
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```

```
#&gt; [1] 2 4 4 6
```


---
# Matrix 
- If we arrange data elements of a vector in a **two-dimensional rectangular layout**, then we have a **matrix**. 
- To construct a matrix, we use a function conveniently called `matrix()`.


```r
y &lt;- matrix(data = c(1:20), nrow = 5, ncol = 4) # generates 5 x 4 numeric matrix
y
```

```
#&gt;      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
#&gt; [1,]    1    6   11   16
#&gt; [2,]    2    7   12   17
#&gt; [3,]    3    8   13   18
#&gt; [4,]    4    9   14   19
#&gt; [5,]    5   10   15   20
```

- We can subset a matrix with [row `,` column]:


```r
y[,4]       # 4th column of matrix
```

```
#&gt; [1] 16 17 18 19 20
```

```r
y[3,]       # 3rd row of matrix
```

```
#&gt; [1]  3  8 13 18
```

---

```r
y[-1, ] # a matrix which excludes the first row
```

```
#&gt;      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
#&gt; [1,]    2    7   12   17
#&gt; [2,]    3    8   13   18
#&gt; [3,]    4    9   14   19
#&gt; [4,]    5   10   15   20
```

```r
y[2:4,1:3]  # rows 2,3,4 of columns 1,2,3
```

```
#&gt;      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#&gt; [1,]    2    7   12
#&gt; [2,]    3    8   13
#&gt; [3,]    4    9   14
```

- Note how we use an **empty placeholder** to indicate that we want to **select all the values** in a row or column, and `-` to indicate that we want to **remove** something.

---
# Array 

- Arrays work the same was as matrices with data of **more than two dimensions**. 

---
# Data frame
- Data frames in `R`, are  matrix type data types which can have elements of any type, but they have to **all be of the same length**.
- A data frame is the most common way of storing tabular data in `R` and something you will likely deal with a lot. 
- As a first approximation, which holds true, probably in the most cases, you can really think of it as a table or a spreadsheet.  
- We use `data.frame()` function to construct a data frame.


```r
mydf &lt;- data.frame("ID" = c(1:4),
                   "Color" = c("red", "white", "red", NA),
                   "Passed" = c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE),
                   "Weight" = c(99, 54, 85, 70),
                   "Height" = c(1.78, 1.67, 1.82, 1.59))
mydf
```

```
#&gt;   ID Color Passed Weight Height
#&gt; 1  1   red   TRUE     99   1.78
#&gt; 2  2 white   TRUE     54   1.67
#&gt; 3  3   red   TRUE     85   1.82
#&gt; 4  4  &lt;NA&gt;  FALSE     70   1.59
```
---
- We can access the elements of a data frame as in matrix:


```r
mydf[1, 2]   # a single element using numbers
```

```
#&gt; [1] "red"
```

```r
mydf[, 1]    # first column in the data frame (as a vector)
```

```
#&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4
```

```r
mydf[3, ]    # the 3rd row (as a data.frame)
```

```
#&gt;   ID Color Passed Weight Height
#&gt; 3  3   red   TRUE     85   1.82
```

```r
mydf[, -1]   # the whole data frame, excluding the first column
```

```
#&gt;   Color Passed Weight Height
#&gt; 1   red   TRUE     99   1.78
#&gt; 2 white   TRUE     54   1.67
#&gt; 3   red   TRUE     85   1.82
#&gt; 4  &lt;NA&gt;  FALSE     70   1.59
```
---
- As well as using numeric values to subset a `data.frame` (or `matrix`), columns
can be accessed by name:


```r
mydf[, "ID"]  # all IDs
```

```
#&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4
```

```r
*mydf$ID    #all IDs
```

```
#&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4
```

```r
mydf$Color[2] # color of the second one
```

```
#&gt; [1] "white"
```

- Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.

# Some other used functions 


|name         |description                                                    |

|`glimpse()`  |data is shown in a transposed way with columns as rows         |
|`distinct()` |shows all the distinct values for a character or factor column |
|`count()`    |shows a count of all the different distinct values in a column |
---
# List
- Lists can have elements of any type with **different lengths**. 
- We use the `list()` function to construct lists:


```r
myl &lt;- list("school"="ITU", "a_vector"=animals, "age"=5.3) # example of a list with 3 components
myl
```

```
#&gt; $school
#&gt; [1] "ITU"
#&gt; 
#&gt; $a_vector
#&gt; [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"   "frog" 
#&gt; 
#&gt; $age
#&gt; [1] 5.3
```
---

```r
myl[["school"]] # component named id in list
```

```
#&gt; [1] "ITU"
```

```r
myl[[2]] # 2nd component of the list
```

```
#&gt; [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"   "frog"
```

```r
myl[[2]][1]  # 1st component of the 2nd component of the list
```

```
#&gt; [1] "mouse"
```

# Extending R base functionality
- `R` comes with a **base system** and **some contributed core packages**. This is what you just downloaded. 
- The functionality of `R` can be significantly extended by using **additional contributed packages**. 
- Those packages typically contain commands (functions) for more specialized tasks. 
- They can also contain example datasets. 

---
# Installing additional packages
- To install additional packages there are two main options:

  - We can use the `RStudio` interface like this:

&lt;img src="images/installpckg1.png" width="20%" /&gt;&lt;img src="images/installpckg2.png" width="20%" /&gt;
---

 - We can install from the `R` console like this:


```r
# to install a package called "lubridate", for example: (more on this later)
install.packages("lubridate", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Make use of the installed packages
- In order to **actually use commands** from the installed packages we also  need to **load** the installed packages. 


```r
library(lubridate)
```
or

```r
require(lubridate)
```

- The difference between the two is that `library` will result in an error, if the library does not exist, whereas `require` will result in a warning.

---
# Seeking help
-  One of the most **immediate ways to get help** is to use the `RStudio` help interface:

&lt;img src="images/rstudiohelp.png" width="30%" /&gt;

- In the default configuration this panel by default can be found at the lower right hand panel of `RStudio`. 
- As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word "Mean", `RStudio` tries to also give a number of suggestions that you might be interested in. The description is then shown in the display window.

---
- If you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you can type:

```r
?barplot
```

- on `R console`.

- If you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:

```r
args(lm)
```

- If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use the
`help.search()` function, which is called by the double question mark `??`.
However, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a
match to your search request

```r
??kruskal
```
- If you can't find what you are looking for, you can use
the [rdocumentation.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that searches
through the help files across all packages available.
