#  What is R Markdown?

-  In the world of **reproducible research**, we want other researchers to easily reproduce what we did in our analysis so that they can be certain that we analyzed our data properly. 
- `R Markdown` allows us to **create documents** that serve as a neat record of our analysis and it presents `R` code alongside its output (graphs, tables, etc.) with external text, equations, data tables, links, and images to explain it.
- `R Markdown` is **a reproducible and dynamic notebook**.

[R Markdown video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/178485416).

- `R Markdown` actually uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)  is a very simple **`markup` language** which provides methods for creating documents with headers, texts, images, links etc. from plain text files, while keeping the original plain text file easy to read. 

- `Markdown` documents can be **converted to many other file types** like .html or .pdf to display the headers, texts, images etc..

- In a similar fashion, `R Markdown` is a language that allows you to embed `R` code directly into a document to present its outputs (graphs, tables, etc.) accompanied by text, equations, data tables, figures, links, and images via [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

- An `R Markdown` file has the `.Rmd` file suffix. Once it is created, an `.Rmd` file can then be **rendered into** a PDF (.pdf), Microsoft Word (.doc), HTML (html), or GitHub (.md) documents, and a range of other formats.  

---

# Download R Markdown

- We first need the `rmarkdown package` on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html)
to get `R Markdown` be working in `RStudio`.

--

- Wee need to run the following commands in `RStudio`:


```{r eval=FALSE, out.width='20%'}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown)
```

---
# Create an R Markdown file

.pull-left[
- To **create a new R Markdown file** (`.Rmd`) in `RStudio`, go to menu bar across the top of the screen 
and select `File -> New File -> R Markdown`.
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rmarkdown1.png')
```
]


---

```{css echo=FALSE}
.pull-left {
  float: left;
  width: 35%;
}
.pull-right {
  float: right;
  width: 65%;
}
```
    
.pull-left[
.left[ - Select the document type you need. 
- For now we **will focus on** a `.html` document, which can be easily converted to other file types later.]
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width='85%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rmarkdown2.png')
```
]

--

- Give it an **informative title** such as "Deneme" for this trial.
- Accept the default Author or edit if you wish.

---

```{css echo=FALSE}
.pull-left {
  float: left;
  width: 25%;
}
.pull-right {
  float: right;
  width: 75%;
}
```
    
.pull-left[
- Go to menu bar across the top of the screen 
and select `File -> Save as` and **save this document as deneme** to a reasonable filename and location. 
- Click on “Knit HTML” button at the top of `RStudio` script pane or click `File > Knit Document` at menu bar. 
See what appears:

--

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width='200%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rmarkdown4.png')
```
]

--
- Also look at the file browser. You should see the `R Markdown` document, i.e. `deneme.Rmd` and the resulting HTML `deneme.html`.
---

# Content structure

```{css echo=FALSE}
.pull-left {
  float: left;
  width: 25%;
}
.pull-right {
  float: right;
  width: 75%;
}
```

.pull-left[
- The newly created `.Rmd` file can have **three** types of text in general:

   - YAML metadata
   - Text
   - `R` Code chunks
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width='150%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rmarkdown3.png')
```
]

---
# YAML metadata

- The first is the **YAML section** containing configurations for the file. 
- This section looks like this: 

```
---
title: "Deneme"
author: "Gul Inan"
date: "10/9/2021"
output: html_document
---
```

- Feel free to change the title and author names and see what results in your rendered report. 
---

- You can stamp the **current time** on your report by doing so:


```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Deneme"
author: "Gül İnan"
date: "`r format(Sys.Date(), '%B %e, %Y')`" #<<
output: html_document
---

```{r, out.width='70%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rmarkdown5.png')
```



---
```{css echo=FALSE}
.pull-left {
  float: left;
  width: 70%;
}
.pull-right {
  float: right;
  width: 30%;
}
``` 
# Text

- Here we present a few commonly used features in `R Markdown`. 
- Feel free to try them out yourself. 

.pull-left[
- Code:

```{markdown}
Plain text.
End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph. 
 *italics* and _italics_  
 **bold** and __bold__  
 $R^2$   
~~strikethrough~~  
inline equation: $A = \pi*r^{2}$
End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph. 
```
]

--

.pull-right[
- Output:

Plain text.
End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph. 
*italics* and _italics_  
**bold** and __bold__  
$R^2$   
~~strikethrough~~  
inline equation: $A = \pi*r^{2}$
]

--

---
```{css echo=FALSE}
.pull-left {
  float: left;
  width: 50%;
}
.pull-right {
  float: right;
  width: 50%;
}
```

# Headers

.pull-left[
- Code:

```{markdown
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

```
]

--
.pull-right[
- Output:

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

]

--

- Note that head sizes and colors will be default ones in your document.
---
```{css echo=FALSE}
.pull-left {
  float: left;
  width: 50%;
}
.pull-right {
  float: right;
  width: 50%;
}
```

# Unordered Lists

.pull-left[
- Code:

```{markdown

- Fruits
    - apples
    - bananas
    - grapes
- Vegetables
    - carrots
    - broccoli
```
]

--
.pull-right[

  float: right;
  width: 50%;
}
```

# Ordered Lists

.pull-left[
- Code:

```{markdown
scary (ordered list)

1. ocelots
1. bears
1. tigers

Not scary (ordered list)

1. elephants
2. monkeys
3. rabbits

```

# Link

- Code:

```{markdown}
This is a link to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
```

--

- Output: 

This is a link to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

---
# Image

- Code:

```{markdown}
![Surprise](https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2019/04/25/thumbs_b_c_fcbe8545d3b85ab8d3ad9f6adff42d49.jpg)

# R Code

- `R` code can be **directly embedded into** an `.Rmd` file and will be executed during rendering. 
- The **result of the code** would be **printed** into resulting report. 

## Inline R code in a sentence

- Surround code with back ticks and r such as ` `r `  and end it with ` ` `.  
- `R` replaces inline code with its results.

- Code:

```{markdown}
Two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`.
```

--

- Output:  

  Two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`.

---

## R code chunks

- Start a `R` code chunk with  ` ```{r} `  and end it with ` ``` `.

- Code:

```{markdown
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- mean(rnorm(100))
x
```
```    

--

- Output:

```{r}
x <- mean(rnorm(100))
x
```
--

- It prints both `R` code and result.

---

## Display options for R code chunks

- There are a large number of chunk options in **knitr** documented at https://yihui.name/knitr/options. 
- Most common two of them are below:

  - `eval`: Whether to evaluate a code chunk (if you do not want to evaluate the R code then ` ```{r, eval=FALSE} `  and end it with ` ``` `).

  - `echo`: Whether to echo (print) the source code in the output document (if you do not want to print the output then` ```{r, echo=FALSE} `  and end it with ` ``` `).
   
---
# Figures

- Code:

`````{markdown
```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
`````
---
- Output:

```{r}
plot(cars)
```   

---

# Figures

- **Figures** that is not generated from R code can be imported by the `knitr::include_graphics()` function, which provides more control over the attributes of the image than the Markdown syntax of `![alt text or image title](path/to/image)` (e.g., you can specify the image width via out.width).

- Code:

`````{markdown
```{r, eval=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2019/04/25/thumbs_b_c_fcbe8545d3b85ab8d3ad9f6adff42d49.jpg")
```
`````
---
- Output:

```{r,  out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2019/04/25/thumbs_b_c_fcbe8545d3b85ab8d3ad9f6adff42d49.jpg")
```

# A short summary to `knitr options`

- [Default-knitr-options](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/03/default-knitr-options-and-hooks/).

---
# Creating .pdf files in R Markdown

- `R Studio` uses `LaTeX` to make `.pdf` documents.

- If you are using `Windows`, go to the [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download) and download the appropriate “Complete MikTeX Installer” for your system, either 32-bit or 64-bit.

- If you are using a `Mac`, go to the [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) and download the “MacTeX.pkg”.

- Running these installers will install a version of `LaTeX` onto your system, which `R` will then be able to call on to compile the `.pdf`.

- To compile a `.pdf` document instead of a `.html` document, change `output: from html_document` to `pdf_document`.
---
# Final remarks

- In a nutshell:

```{r, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rmarkdown6.png')
```
